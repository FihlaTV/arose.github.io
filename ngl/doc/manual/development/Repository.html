		<h1>[name]</h1>

		Development is coordinated through github: <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/arose/ngl">http://github.com/arose/ngl</a>. Please use the issue tracker there to report bugs or suggest improvements. Pull requests are also welcome.


		<h2>Report issues</h2>

		For your reports on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/arose/ngl/issues">issue tracker</a>, please provide a comprehensive description and include any information required to understand or reproduce the matter.


		<h2>Development environment</h2>

		To develop for the NGL Viewer you need a local copy of the source code, which you can obtain by forking the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/arose/ngl">ngl repository</a> on github. Read about how to <a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork a repository</a>.


		<h2>Pull request</h2>

		<p>Development of new features is done the *dev* branch, so unless you want to contribute a bug-fix for a release in the the *master* branch, your pull request must be against the *dev* branch.</p>

		<p>First make sure you are in the *dev* branch.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git checkout dev</code>

		<p>Create a new branch.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]</code>

		<p>Push your new branch to the origin of your local repository, probably on github.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]</code>

		<p>If in the meantime the main ngl *dev* branch has been updated you must update your branch accordingly. You can read more about how to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">sync a fork</a>.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git fetch upstream</code>

		<p>After fetching you need to merge the changes.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git merge upstream/dev</code>

		<p>When you are satisfied with your changes, it is time to start a pull request via the github web interface as described <a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">here</a>.</p>

		<p>After a completed pull request you can delete the corresponding branch on your local filesystem.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]</code>

		<p>And also delete the branch on github. Note the colon <strong>:</strong> in front of the branch name.</p>
		<code lang="bash">git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]</code>
